# CodeBlocks Theme

## Standalone:

Download the CodeBlocks.theme.css and put it into the Themes folder of Discord.
If you want to edit any description you can open the file and change what is written within the ",
e.g.:
`--des-java: "Java"` -> `--des-java: "A different name for Java"`

## Implemented:

Copy anything except for the //META part of CodeBlocks.theme.css into your theme and edit what you want except the @import
